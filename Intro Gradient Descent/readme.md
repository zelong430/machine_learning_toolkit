## Demo Program of Gradient Descent
### Overview
This is a python program to fit a straight line through a provided dataset in csv format. 
The program use Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the line with minimum total squared error.
### Usage
Run ``python demo.py data.csv`` to see the results:

   ```
Starting gredient descent on dataset data.csv, with a = 0, b = 0, total squared error = 2782.5539172416056
Running
Starting gredient descent on dataset data.csv, with a = 1.478268785405718, b = 0.03204543369619705, total squared error = 56.32487362892257
   ```
You could also provide your own data file, which has to be a csv file with first column contains the x values
and the second columns contains the y values.
